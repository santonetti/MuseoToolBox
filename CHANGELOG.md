## [Unreleased : 0.12.1-beta.1] - 

### Added

- New attributes : self._offsets (list) and self._function_is_3d (list)
- Some functions are added to RasterMath :
	- _check_add_function
	- add_spatial_function
	- _iter_for_spatial_function
	- _return_block
				

### Changed

- SequentialFeatureSelection parameters order Changed. *scoring* is now before *standardize*.
- Fix bug in get_block() and get_random_block() which returned the same block each time due to new method.
- Update doc for load_historical_data()
- Fix bug with nodata in RasterMath when output is of float type
- Some functions have changed in RasterMath :
	- add_function
	- _generate_block_array
	- get_block
	- get_random_block
	- iter_block
	- run

## [0.12] - 2019-12-13

### Changed

- RasterMath made a lot of improvements using block reading and writing. For example, the default block size is now 256x256 (you can keep the default block size by choosing block_size=False), and Museo ToolBox automatic detect if the geotiff will be tiled or not (it depends on the block size).
- Some folders have Changed name :
	- raster_tools and vector_tools to processing
	- learn_tools to ai
- some functions have Changed name : 
	- getSamplesFromROI to extract_values
	- historicalMap to load_historical_data
	- getDistanceMatrix to get_distance_matrix
- classes now always begin with a capital case : 
    - learnAndPredict to SuperLearner
    - rasterMath to RasterMath
    - sequentialFeatureSelection to SequentialFeatureSelection 
- Fix bug #7 : getSamplesFromROI (nowd extract_ROI) now extracts ROI values using by default memory. If it fails, it will create a temporary raster on disk then delete it when finished. 

### Removed

- Remove command lines (cli)

## [0.12rc5] - 2019-11-11
	
### Changed

- getSamplesFromROI return list of available fields if wrong field given.
- rasterMath convert np.nan value to nodata value (if numpy >= 1.17)

## [0.12rc4] - 2019-11-01

### Changed

- Minor fix when using learnAndPredict with an outside customized function
- Better management fo cross-validation in learnAndPredict
- Fix minor bug using False or None value with cv in learnAndPredict

### Added

- Add an option to use SFS without writing each best model on the disk.

## [0.12rc3] - 2019-10-29

### Added

- Move some functions from vector_tools to raster_tools, functions are anyway still available from vector_tools

### Changed

- learnAndPredict manages int value for cross-validation by using RandomStratifiedKFold
- Enhance blocksize management for rasterMath
- Move command line code in _cli folder

## [0.12rc2] - 2019-10-14

### Changed

- Improvements of rasterMath
	- customBlockSize defines now the same block size for window reading and for the output
	- add seed parameter (to set a random generator) in getRandomBlock()
	- add getRasterParameters() and customRasterParameters() function.

## [0.12rc1] - 2019-10-12

### Changed

- update rasterMath to generate by default a 256*256 raster block size.
- update rasterMath to prevent bug if user has osgeo/gdal version is lower than 2.1.
- prevent bug when in rasterMath if processor has only 1 core.
- minor fixes and doc update
